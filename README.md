# Furret Skinpack

by KADW (KADW#4425)

A collection of four Furret skins for Rain World 1.9, which can be used with the [Dress My Slugcat mod](https://github.com/MatheusVigaro/DressMySlugcat/releases). Normal Furret has Furret's normal colors (brown and light yellow), Shiny Furret is white and pink, Rainbow Furret is white and rainbow, and Monochrome Furret is gray but can be recolored. Use with default skin settings on.

Available through Steam Workshop/Remix at [this link](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2967714691), so get it from there. If you don't have Rain World through Steam, you can still install this skinpack by clicking the green Code button, then Download ZIP. Unzip the file and move Furret Skinpack_final into your Rain World/RainWorld_Data/StreamingAssets/mods folder.

Port of the original skinpack, which was made for Rain World 1.5.
